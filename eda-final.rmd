# Intro

First Lets see what data says about unrelated variable(to be predicted variable).

```{r}
base_folder <- "/home/cafebazaar/R-Projects/diabet/" # change this:)
data_folder <- paste0(base_folder, "data/")
output_folder <- paste0(base_folder, "output/")

diabetes_012_path <- paste0(data_folder,"diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
diabetes_binary_5050_path <- paste0(data_folder, "diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
diabetes_binary_path <- paste0(data_folder, "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")


library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
```

## Data

Let's have a look at data summery to see what we got!

```{r}
dt_5050 <- data.table(read.csv(diabetes_binary_5050_path))

summary(dt_5050)
```


## Correlation
To get some info and intuition about features we get correlation matrix of data to understand and analyse it.

![Correlation Matrix](output/cor-matrix.png)

We can see that some features have good correlation with diabetes binary. So we can explore more to find out more about our features and data.

## Feature Distribution diabetes vs no-diabetes

### BMI
![BMI Distributions](output/BMI-distribution.png)


As we can see people with higher BMI are more likely to have Diabetes.We can use this feature to predict whether someone has diabetes or not.

### General Health
![General Health Distributions](output/General-health-distribution.png)


Is more shifted to right meaning people with diabetes have worse general health condition than others. people who answered they have poor health have a strong indication of diabetes. For example if we classify based on category 4,5 our accuracy can be good but this is a simple model with more complex models and more tuning we can predict the answer.

### High Blood Pressure

![General High Blood Pressure](output/High-Blood-Pressure-distribution.png)


Having High blood pressure is a good indicator for diabetes people with high blood pressure are more likely to have diabetes!



# Conclusion

We can clearly see that this data can say a lot about the to be predicted variable(diabetes binary). We showed 3 great predictors so there is good reason to believe we can have a nice enough prediction using this data.
