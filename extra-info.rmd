## Variable selection method

We used caret package for variable selection it used backward selection method which we were taught in the class

## Hyper-Parameter Search

We used grid search method meaning we created a grid of different parameter values and did a search to find the optimum parameters

## Question 5

We forgot to mention that even though we made our model smaller in order to compute it on a browser we need to fit the model first and then send the fited model to user!

also there is way in which you can make a random forest with large number of trees and choose the ones with lower out of the bag error

I researched a lot of libraries for this problem and found cool tools :) They are a little tricky to install. beware!
